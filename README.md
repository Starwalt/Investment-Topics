Investment
• Investment – current sacrifice for future benefits.
• Two key aspects are time & risk.
• Sacrifice takes place now & is certain.
• Benefit is expected in future and tend to be
uncertain.
• Almost everyone owns a portfolio, which is likely to
comprise financial assets (bank deposits, bonds,
stocks, and so on) and real assets ( car, house, and so
on).
Investment Vs Speculation
Investor Speculator
Planning Horizon Relatively longer. Usually
for a year or more
Very short. May be few
days, weeks
Risk dispersion Not willing to assume more
than moderate risk
Ordinarily assumes high
risk
Return Expectation Modest return
commensurate with the
moderate risk assumed
Looks for high return in
return for the high risk
assumed
Basis for decisions Attaches greater
significance to
Fundamental factors
Relies more on technical
charts.
Leverage Uses his own funds Normally resorts to
borrowings which is
substantial, to supplement
his personal resources
Gambling
Ex. horse race, card games, lotteries etc.
 involves high risk and
 one engage not only for the high return
but for the associated excitement / fun.
 result of gambling is known more quickly.
 it does not involve bet on economic
activity.
The Asset Allocation Decision
What is Asset Allocation?
• Asset Allocation:
Process - how to distribute one’s wealth among asset
classes.
• Asset Class:
Group of securities that have similar characteristics,
attributes, and risk/return relationships.
• Investor:
Depending on the type of investors, investment
objectives and constraints vary
– Individual investors
– Institutional investors
Individual Investor Life Cycle
• Financial Plan Preliminaries
– Life Insurance:
death benefits + possibly, additional cash values
• Term life and whole life insurance
• Endowment and money back life insurance
– Non-life Insurance
• Health insurance & Disability insurance
• Automobile insurance & Home insurance
– Cash Reserve
• To meet emergency needs
• Equal to six months living expenses
Individual Investor Life Cycle…
• Life Cycle Phases (Exhibit 2.1)
– Accumulation phase: Early to middle years of
working career
– Consolidation phase: Past midpoint of careers.
Earnings greater than expenses
– Spending/Gifting phase: Begins after retirement
• Life Cycle Investment Goals
– Near-term, high-priority goals – house down pay
– Long-term, high-priority goals – edu / marriage
– Lower-priority goals – new car when introduced
Exhibit 2.1
Investment Objectives
• Risk Objectives
– should be based on investor’s ability and
willingness to take risk.
– Risk tolerance depends on an investor’s current
net worth and income expectations and age.
– A careful analysis of the client’s risk tolerance
should precede any discussion of return
objectives.
Investment Objectives…
• Return Objectives
– May be stated in terms of an absolute or a relative
percentage return.
– Capital Preservation: Minimize risk of real losses
– Capital Appreciation: Growth of the portfolio in
real terms (capital gains) to meet future need
– Current Income: Focus is in generating income
rather than capital gains
– Total Return: Increase portfolio value by Capital
gain + reinvestment current income with moderate
risk exposure.
Investment Constraints
• Liquidity Needs
– Vary between investors depending upon age,
employment, tax status, etc.
Ex. Planned vacation expenses and house down
payment.
• Time Horizons
– Influences liquidity needs and risk tolerance.
– Longer investment horizons generally requires
less liquidity and more risk tolerance.
– Two general time horizons are pre-retirement
and post-retirement periods.
Investment Constraints…
• Tax Concerns
– Capital gains or losses: Taxed differently from
income
– Unrealized capital gains: Reflect price appreciation
in assets that have not yet been sold
– Realized capital gains: When the asset has been
sold at a profit
– Marginal tax rate Vs Average Tax rate
– Interest on tax free bonds exempt from income tax
– NPS contributions
Legal and Regulatory Factors
• Limitations or penalties on withdrawals of
FDs
• tax to be paid for pre closure of retirement
corpus such as EPF/Life Insurance Policies
etc
• Investment laws prohibit insider trading
Unique Needs and Preferences
• Personal preferences such as socially
conscious investments could influence
investment choice. (Ex. Avoid tobacco, alcohol
manufacturing company)
• Time constraints or lack of expertise may
require professional management.
• Large investment in employer’s stock may
require consideration of diversification needs.
• Institutional investors needs. (pension funds,
Insurance companies)?
The Importance of Asset Allocation
• An investment strategy is based on four
decisions
– What asset classes for investment
– What policy weights to each eligible class
– What allocation ranges are allowed based on policy
weights
– What specific securities to purchase
• According to research studies (Ibbotson and
Kaplan (2000) and others), most (90%) of the
overall investment return is due to the first two
decisions, not the selection of individual
investments
The Importance of Asset Allocation…
• Returns and Risks of Different Asset Classes
– Historically, small company stocks have generated
the highest returns, so have the volatility
– Inflation and taxes have a major impact on returns
– Returns on Treasury Bills have barely kept pace
with inflation
– Measuring risk by the probability of not meeting
your investment return objective indicates risk of
equities is small and that of T-bills is large because
of their differences in expected returns
Objectives and Constraints of Institutional
Investors
• Banks
– Must attract funds in a competitive interest rate
environment
– maintain a positive difference between their cost
and return
– Need substantial liquidity to meet withdrawals and
loan demands
– Face regulatory constraints
• Mutual Funds
– Pool investors funds and invests them in financial
assets as per its investment objective
Objectives and Constraints of Institutional
Investors
• Pension Funds
– Receive contributions from the firm, its employees,
or both and invests those funds
– Defined Benefit – promise to pay retirees a specific
income stream after retirement
– Defined Contribution – do not promise a set of
benefits. Employees’ retirement income is not an
obligation of the firm
Objectives and Constraints of
Institutional Investors
Life-Insurance Companies
 earn rate in excess of
actuarial rate
 growing surplus if the spread
is positive
 fiduciary principles limit the
risk tolerance
 liquidity needs have
increased
 tax rule changes
Non-Life Insurance Companies
 cash flows less predictable
 fiduciary responsibility to
claimants
 Risk exposure low to
moderate
 liquidity concerns due to
uncertain claim patterns
